Flatiron School Phase 2 Project

Summary
This single page application was created with React to collaborate with other triathletes on their past experience at particular race venues. It is made to help someone who is new to the sport or particular race location to get familiar and prepared for the big day! A race recon is known as doing an exploratory survey of the race, which is why I call it My Race Recon journal. 

Form
The form on the page allows you to fill out the swim, bike and run information for a particular race. -- Users are able to POST a race recon and VIEW other people's responses. 

Client-Side Routes
The project includes the following client-side routes using React Router:
1) Index /recons Display all race recons
2) New /recons/new Display new race recon form
3) Show /recons/:id Display a single race recon's info

There also is included a nav bar to navigate between the Home and Race Recons routes while each Race Recon has a dedicated link to SHOW the single race recon's info.
